//Simple MUTEX usage
Usage:
	make
	gcc user_1.c -o user_1
	gcc user_2.c -o user_2


	sudo insmod dynammic_no.ko
	# cat /prov/devices
	sudo mknod /dev/vivek_test<file> c <major no> <minor no>



This user application will write some data to kernel. kernel driver will read the data and print it using printk.


// mutex usage
This has mutex function	
	struct mutex mutex_vdev;
	mutex_init(&mutex_vdev);
	
	mutex_locked(&mutex_vdev);
		....
		(critical secton)
		....
	mutex_unlocked(&mutex_vdev);


	There are many more functions with ,mutex usage
	
		mutex_lock_interruptible
		mutex_lock_killable
		mutex_trylock
		mutex_trylock_recursive
		mutex_is_locked


NOTE  : 
     *  1. Only one process can open file  at a time (i.e remianing has to wait)  , remaing process which is trying to access need to wait until old process release	
		lock is creted while in opening function 
		lock is removed in closing function
	2. dump stack is preinted in kernel.
